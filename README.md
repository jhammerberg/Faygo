# Faygo API
The Faygo API is a multipurpose and universal GUI API for ComputerCraft.

The goal of Faygo is to provide an easy way to draw elements on any screen or terminal, and eventually a way to implement asynchronous buttons, that again work on terminals or touchscreens with the same code.

Why is it called Faygo?\
Because I needed to name the folder something so I looked around my room and saw a bottle of Faygo :)
